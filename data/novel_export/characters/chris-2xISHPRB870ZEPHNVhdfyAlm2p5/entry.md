## Chris

**Tags:** Student, Rebel, Security Conflict

**Age:** 22

**Address:** Student Housing Block A

**Motivation:** To reconcile his sense of order with his conscience. To protect others, even if it means turning against his past allies.

**Background:** Former military family, joined the university to study law enforcement tech but began questioning authority after a personal incident. Known for keeping routines and sticking to the rulesâ€”until the rules started hurting people.

**Connections:** Rueben (former mentor), Kamea (disagreed in debates), Melanie (grew close after defection)

**Summary:** Chris starts out assisting university security but defects after seeing the mistreatment of refugees. A complex, morally grey character, caught between instinct and awakening.
