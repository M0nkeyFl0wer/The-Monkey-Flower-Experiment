## Randy

**Aliases:** R

**Tags:** Student, Hacker, Tech Support, Quiet Organizer, Anti-Authoritarian

**Age:** 24

**Address:** Student Housing Block C

**Motivation:** Let his work do the talking. Solve problems quietly. Resist control. Create systems that help people help themselves.

**Background:** Worked on mutual aid infrastructure in several cities before enrolling in the distributed systems pilot. Lost someone close, and rarely talks about it. Known for his algae-dyed hair and the patched mesh routers he built into the trees.

**Connections:** Melanie (tech support partner), Tria (trusts her with secrets), Chris (shared projects)

**Summary:** Randy is a brilliant and introverted systems thinker who built much of the mesh network now keeping people connected. His loyalty is to the work and the peopleâ€”not to any leader.
