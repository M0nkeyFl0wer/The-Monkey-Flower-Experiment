## Jasper

**Tags:** Staff, 3D Printing Specialist, Builder

**Pronouns:** they/them

**Age:** 38

**Address:** Workshop Tent near Printer Bay

**Motivation:** To build quickly, quietly, and with as little drama as possible.

**Background:** Originally a sculptor, Jasper was brought in on a short contract to oversee architectural printing experiments. Ended up becoming the de facto coordinator of emergency shelter construction.

**Connections:** Tom (work partner), Melanie (constant requests), Frank (argues about material use)

**Summary:** Jasper works all night and hates meetings. Theyâ€™ve been repurposing furniture, printer blocks, and even old campus signage into shelters. A true artist of survival.
