Reflections on a Tumultuous Night

"As the storm approaches, both literally and figuratively, Akima's community is divided yet resilient. Tonight, the board chose bureaucracy over immediate action. But in the shadows, students and volunteers worked tirelessly to bring desperate families to safety.

@Kamea might have faced resistance from authority, but her spirit remains unbroken. @Randy and others managed to bypass obstacles to do what was right for those who needed it most. We, the true community of Akima, will not wait for decisions to trickle down from those in power. We make our own pathways.

For now, we brace ourselves for both the storm outside and the challenges within. And as always, weâ€™ll continue to hold power accountable through transparent action and relentless compassion._

Stay tuned as we keep you updated on every development. Together, we navigate this night and beyond."

Tria, Signing Off.
