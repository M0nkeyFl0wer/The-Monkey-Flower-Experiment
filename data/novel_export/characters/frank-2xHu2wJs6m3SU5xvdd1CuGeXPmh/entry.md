Next kind of a cummudgingly professor. He's a math professor in the chair of the senate. He has white hair and a white beard and a gruff voice. He's a powerful but also very affectionate and considerate but serious and detail-oriented guy. A fighter for truth and justice in his own way but also pretty conservative status quo loving.
