## Amir

**Tags:** Student, Disabled, Mathematician

**Pronouns:** he/they

**Age:** 20

**Address:** Student Housing Block D (ADA-accessible unit)

**Motivation:** To prove he’s useful, even when people ignore him. To track the data others miss.

**Background:** Autistic and mobility-impaired, Amir has a unique way of seeing problems. He’s been quietly compiling resource data and social graphs from public network pings. Once rejected by the board, now increasingly respected.

**Connections:** Frank (math mentor), Tria (data source), Kamea (admirer of his models)

**Summary:** Amir doesn’t talk much and rarely shows up in group photos. But if you want to know who has power—or how long the water might last—ask Amir. He probably already built the dashboard.
