Tria is a journalist and it's their job to keep those in power in check. That now means critically reporting on Akima. Their relationship is in danger along with their lives.



Tria has a strong sense of Justice and fairness. She feels a deep sense of connection to her community. She uses cybernetic technology in pursuit of her journalism getting access and angles thanks to her cybernetic tail and the myriad of cameras she has at her disposal including those imbedded in some local animals that had them installed for as medical support.



Tria is an activist who feels strongly about independently journalism, open source software, transparency and accountability for those in power as well as privacy and security for everyone else.



Tria loves animals and the woods and has a hard time trusting people as much as she trusts animals.
