## Tom

**Tags:** Staff, Groundskeeper, Mountain Expert

**Age:** 58

**Address:** Remote Maintenance Cabin 1

**Motivation:** To keep the lights on and the water flowing. To do his job, quietly and well.

**Background:** Former firefighter. Lives in a university-owned cabin near the hydro station and reports to no one. Knows every path, tree, and generator on the mountain.

**Connections:** Randy (respects his work), Tria (has fixed her drone more than once), Sarah (shares tea occasionally)

**Summary:** Tom is an older groundskeeper who knows the terrain of the mountain better than anyone. He becomes essential to survival after the storm. Quiet, steady, and underestimated.
