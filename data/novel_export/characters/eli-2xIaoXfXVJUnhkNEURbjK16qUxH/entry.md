## Eli

**Tags:** Tech, Observation Post, Intern, Cut Off

**Pronouns:** he/him

**Age:** 19

**Address:** Observation Deck Post (Off-Grid Shelter)

**Motivation:** To get back in range. To finish his fieldwork. To not panic.

**Background:** First-year engineering intern placed up at the radio tower. Got stuck when the storm hit. Communicates via glitchy uplink nodes and solar repeater drones. Documents everything.

**Connections:** Randy (tech idol), Sarah (debrief contact), Tria (increasingly obsessed with reaching her)

**Summary:** Eli is alone and just barely online, but his logs are slowly becoming critical to understanding the scope of the disaster. Nobody remembers approving his placementâ€”and now he's the eyes in the sky.
