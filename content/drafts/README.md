## How to Review

1. **Read in order**: Chris → Sarah → Tria → Kamea
   - Notice how each perspective reveals different layers of the same event
   - See how character voice is established

2. **Refine as needed**:
   - Edit for your preferred tone per character
   - These edits establish the voice baseline for all future generation
   - Your changes will be preserved and learned from

3. **Provide feedback on**:
   - Specificity: Names, times, details feel right?
   - Tone: Does each character sound like their perspective?
   - Length: Good balance of short updates vs. long analysis?
   - Grounding: Are posts about witnessed events, not abstractions?

## Key Improvements from Earlier Version

✅ **Specific not philosophical**
   - Names Robert Chen (treasurer), Provost Chen, specific times
   - "I counted 11 families" not "systems are cruel"

✅ **Character voice differentiated**
   - Chris: Security protocol conflicted with conscience
   - Sarah: Ethical analysis and wisdom-seeking
   - Tria: Journalist precision, documentation
   - Kamea: Activist urgency, community organizing

✅ **Grounded in actual story**
   - References novel canon (Robert's budget concerns, etc.)
   - Uses actual character names and relationships
   - Builds narrative through multiple perspectives

✅ **Multiple post types with length variety**
   - Social: 100-150 words (tweet-length, quick updates)
   - Blog: 400-600+ words (anchor posts, detailed narrative)

## Next Steps

After you've reviewed and refined:

1. **Approve** these 8 posts (with any edits)
2. **Generate for other scenes**:
   - Rescue in the Woods (Randy's perspective)
   - The Storm Approaches (everyone's perspective as crisis unfolds)
   - Randy's direct action coordination
   - Additional secondary characters

3. **Scale up** to full character roster once voice baseline is established
