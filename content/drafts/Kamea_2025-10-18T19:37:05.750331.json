Prof. Martinez nodded \nbut stayed silent.

      "content": "I stood in that board room for forty-three minutes tonight while they debated our humanity like a budget line item.\n\nEmergency meeting. I crashed it. Walked right past Security Chief Morrison\u2014he knows me by now, didn't even bother stopping me\u2014and interrupted Provost Chen mid-sentence about \"facility maintenance schedules.\" \n\n\"Three families are sleeping under tarps by the south field right now,\" I said. \"Children. In the rain. What are we doing about it?\"\n\nYou should have seen their faces. Like I'd asked them to personally house people in their offices. Which, for the record, I would absolutely propose if we can't do better.\n\nRobert Chen, treasurer, had his spreadsheet ready. Always does. \"Campus liability... insurance complications... proper immigration channels... budgetary constraints for the semester already allocated...\" He went on for eight minutes. I timed it. Eight minutes of why we can't help people who need shelter *right now*.\n\nI looked him in the eye. \"Humanity and sustainability go hand-in-hand, Robert. These aren't statistics on your sheet\u2014they're our neighbors. The same neighbors who'll remember whether we chose paperwork over people.\"\n\nProvost Chen did that thing where she looks sympathetic while saying no. \"We appreciate your passion, Kamea, but there are proper channels\u2014\"\n\n\"The proper channel is drowning in bureaucracy while people drown in rain.\"\n\nThey formed a committee. Emergency Refugee Support Exploration Committee. I'm on it, along with Robert, Professor Adeola from Sociology, and two Student Union reps they're \"identifying.\" First meeting: next Tuesday.\n\nNext. Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm running an encrypted thread coordinating dorm rooms, meal swipes, and dry clothing. Already have seventeen students offering space. The mesh network we built for organizing protests? Tonight it's a mutual aid coordinator. \n\nThe board can explore their channels. We're building our own.\n\nThis is what resistance looks like on a Tuesday night\u2014bureaucrats protecting institutions while students protect people. They'll write reports. We'll write history.\n\nTuesday's committee meeting will be interesting. I'm documenting everything.\n\n\u2014K",
