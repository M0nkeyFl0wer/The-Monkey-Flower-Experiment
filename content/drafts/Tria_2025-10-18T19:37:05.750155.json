      "content": "WHAT \"PROPER CHANNELS\" LOOKS LIKE WHEN PEOPLE ARE DROWNING\n\nI sat through two hours of the emergency board meeting tonight. Emergency. Let that word sit in your mouth while I tell you what happened.\n\nKamea interrupted Dean Morrison mid-sentence about parking policy updates. Just stood up in the gallery and said: \"There are forty-three people sleeping in the rain outside the south entrance right now. Three of them are children under five. When does this board plan to do something about it?\"\n\nYou could hear the ventilation system. That's how quiet it got.\n\nRobert Chen, our treasurer, had his spreadsheet ready. Actually pulled up a cost-benefit analysis he'd apparently been working on. \"We have to consider institutional liability,\" he said. \"Insurance doesn't cover non-students on campus property. If someone gets hurt\u2014\"\n\n\"They're already hurt,\" Kamea shot back. \"They walked here through a tropical storm because they had nowhere else to go. They're sleeping on concrete. One of the kids has a fever.\"\n\nMorrison tried his calming voice. \"We all sympathize, but we need to work through proper channels. FEMA, county resources\u2014\"\n\n\"FEMA has a six-week backlog,\" Kamea said. She had numbers too. \"County shelters are at 140% capacity. The 'proper channels' you're talking about are underwater. Literally. The south county shelter flooded three days ago.\"\n\nThis is where it got interesting. Chen actually paused. Put down his stylus. Said: \"I hear you. But where do we draw the line? If we set precedent that campus facilities\u2014\"\n\n\"Humanity and sustainability go hand-in-hand,\" Kamea interrupted. \"This isn't statistics. These are our neighbors. Some of them helped run the mesh network before the university even approved it. Maria Reyes? She's out there with her kids. She taught half your biology labs emergency food preservation last year.\"\n\nSilence. Morrison checked the time on his phone. \"I propose we form an ad hoc committee to explore options within our institutional framework.\"\n\nAnd that's what they did. Formed a committee. Scheduled a meeting for Thursday.\n\nIt's Monday night. The rain hasn't stopped. The families are still outside.\n\nI'm done pretending this is complicated. It's not complicated. It's cowardice dressed in policy language.\n\nMore to come when the committee actually meets. If I can stomach sitting through it.",
