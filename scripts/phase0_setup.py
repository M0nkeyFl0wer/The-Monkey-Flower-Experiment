SCENE: Emergency Board Meeting - Resistance Against Bureaucracy

Kamea interrupts the mundane board meeting demanding immediate action for refugee support.
The board discusses "proper channels" and "institutional liability" while families
sleep in the rain outside. Robert (treasurer) argues resources vs. morality.
Kamea's rebuttal: "Humanity and sustainability go hand-in-hand. This isn't statistics‚Äîit's our neighbors."

A committee is formed. Decisive action is deferred.

You were there. What did you witness? What was your role? What do you think happened?
What will you tell people on the network?

SCENE: Quiet Help in the Woods - Direct Action

While Kamea faces security/board resistance, Randy leads volunteers bringing stranded
families through the woods to safety. Heavy rain. Equipment failing. But they move anyway.
They don't ask for permission. They just act.

The network lights up with encrypted coordinates, supply requests, safe house info.
This is what resistance looks like when you stop waiting for approval.
