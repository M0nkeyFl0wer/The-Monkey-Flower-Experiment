üö® SCENE: Emergency Board Meeting - June 3, 2025, 1:17 PM

THE SETUP:
Kamea walked into the board meeting uninvited and demanded shelter for the families.
Robert started talking about liability. The board talked. Talked. Talked.
Kamea: "Our neighbors are sleeping in the rain and we're discussing committees."
Board response: Form a committee. Meet next week.

THE ACTION HAPPENING NOW:
- Randy is physically moving families from south field to dry shelter (17 students volunteering)
- Eli is running encrypted comms so they can coordinate invisibly
- Amir is hitting up every student with access to dorm rooms, food, heat
- Chris is deciding right now: do I write the "unauthorized camping" report or no?
- Tria is documenting this for the record
- Sarah is processing what she just witnessed
- Melanie is watching students do what the board won't
- Kamea is planning Phase 2

THE EMOTIONAL CORE:
The board chose procedures over people. The community chose action over permission.
This is the fork in the road. This is where people choose sides.

YOUR CHARACTER IS DOING SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.
Not reflecting. ACTING.

What is it?

You can see them. Families. Kids under tarps. A kid's shoe in the mud.

You have the report form. Unauthorized camping. You can file it.
Or you can "forget" to write it.

Kamea locked eyes with you as she left the meeting. Not begging. Just... seeing if you're really a security officer or just a person.

What do you do with that form? What do you tell yourself about it?""",

        "Sarah": """RIGHT NOW: You're walking back to your office, your mind on fire.
You were in that room. You tried. You said "we should act immediately."
Provost Chen smiled and patted your arm like you were a student.

Eight minutes. Robert spent eight minutes explaining why people deserve to wait.

Your phone buzzes. Randy: "We're moving them. Come help?"

You're an ethicist. What does ethics demand you do in the next hour?""",

Word for word. Quote for quote. Timestamp: 1:32 PM - Robert's exact words about liability.

Your network feed is LIT. Randy coordinating pickup points. Eli routing comms.
Amir saying "I've got 8 dorm rooms ready to go."

You can report what the board said. Or you can also report what the community is DOING.

What goes in the report?""",

Your hands are shaking. Not from fear. From rage at how polite they were about refusing.

Amir's already texting. Randy's moving. Eli's online.
You didn't ask permission. You didn't need to. They were waiting for someone to say DO IT.

What message do you send RIGHT NOW that galvanizes the next phase?""",

They have a 6-year-old. Mother is crying from relief.
Amir's got three more families queued up. Eli's routing you through back paths.

The board is still talking about procedures. You're out here in the mud saving lives.

What are you experiencing? What are you telling your crew?""",

You're watching Ryan and Josh secure the encrypted channels.
Comms are flowing: coordinates, family names, safe houses, resource needs.

This network was built to resist surveillance. Tonight it's resisting bureaucracy.
Chris might check the logs. You know the workarounds.

What are you doing with this infrastructure RIGHT NOW?""",

You advocated. The board ignored you. They chose process over urgency.

Your phone: Randy asking for equipment access. Kamea: "We're doing this."
Amir: "Faculty support means a lot. Can you cover if security questions it?"

You're on the board. You know the systems. What are you willing to do?""",

That was the signal.

You're hitting the group chat. 8 responses in 60 seconds.
Students saying: I've got a dorm. I've got meal swipes. I've got blankets.

Randy: "We're moving them."
Eli: "Network is active."
Tria: "I'm documenting."

You're 19 years old. This is your community. What do you DO?""",
