## Image Generation Strategy

**Recommendation:** Hybrid approach

1. **Claude/DALL-E for drafts** - Fast iteration, concept testing
2. **Midjourney for finals** - Publication-quality for magazine

See: `docs/IMAGE_GENERATION_STRATEGY.md` for full strategy

## Workflow

```
Review Issue → Edit in GitHub → Approve/Request Changes
                                        ↓
                            I process feedback
                                        ↓
                        Extract images → Generate images
                                        ↓
                          Final approval → Publish
```

## Security

✅ **No secrets exposed**
- SSH connection details removed
- API keys not in repo
- `.gitignore` configured for drafts

**All good for public GitHub repo.**
